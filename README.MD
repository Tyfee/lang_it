Langit means sky in some austronesian languages (malay being one i can speak).

Current WSL binary is at 203kb. My goal is to be able to achieve C1 translation between PT and a different language with a compiled binary with less than 1mb. 

## why would i do that to myself

Starting some serious studies about computational linguistics and machine translation, i wanted to know how far i can get with small amounts of code for a translation program based on rules on lemmas and stems.

At first, My goal is to introduce the following translations, and then pivot them between each other, so that any can be translated to any other:

| FROM          | TO            | STATUS |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| Portuguese    | English       |        |
| English       | French        |        |
| Spanish       | Portuguese    |        |
| Swedish       | English       |        |
